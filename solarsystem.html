    <h1>Our Solar System</h1>
    <p>The Solar System,[d] named after Sōl, the Latin name for the Sun, is the planetary system of the Sun and the celestial objects that orbit it.[11] It formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.

The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, there are four terrestrial planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — two gas giants — Jupiter and Saturn — and finally two ice giants — Uranus and Neptune. All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely giant planets are mainly composed of fluids and as such do not have a fixed surface. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is located within the Sun, and nearly 90% of the rest forms Jupiter and Saturn.</p> <br>

   <span>Earth.</span>
   <p>Earth is our life-rich home, the only known planet with stable liquid water, an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, active geology, and diverse ecosystems. It's the third planet from the Sun.</p>

    <img src="images/Mars.jfif" alt="picture of mars">
    <span>Mars.</span>
    <p>Mars, the “Red Planet,” is a cold, dusty desert world with polar ice caps, massive volcanoes, canyons, and a thin CO₂ atmosphere. It shows evidence of past water and is a focus for rover missions.

    <img src="images/Jupiter.jfif" alt="picture of Jupiter">
    <span>Jupiter.</span>
    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet, more than twice the mass of all other planets combined. It's a gas giant made of hydrogen and helium, famous for its Great Red Spot—a centuries-old storm—and at least 95 moons.</p>

    <img src="images/Mercury.jfif" alt="picture of Mercury">
    <span>Mercury.</span>
    <p>
        Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, a rocky world bathed in extreme temperatures—from about 180°C at night to +430°C during the day. It has a cratered surface and virtually no atmosphere.

    <img class="In" src="images/Neptune.jfif" alt="picture of neptune"> 
    <span>Neptune.</span>
    <p>
        Neptune is the most distant planet, another ice giant with hydrogen, helium, and methane atmosphere giving its deep blue color. It has ultra-fast winds, dark storms, six rings, and 16 moons.

    <img src="images/Saturn.jfif" alt="picture of Saturn"> 
    <span>Saturn.</span>
    <p>
        Saturn is known for its stunning rings composed of ice and dust. It's a gas giant like Jupiter—mostly hydrogen and helium—with a pale yellow cloud layer and around 200 moons.
    </p>

<div>
    <img class="In" src="images/Uranus.jfif" alt="picture of Uranus">
    <span>Uranus.</span>
    <p>
        Uranus, an ice giant, spins nearly on its side (~98° tilt). It's cold and windy, with methane-rich blue-green atmosphere, faint rings, and 27 known moons.

<div>
    <img src="images/Venus.jfif" alt="Picture of Venus">
    <span>Venus.</span>
    <p>
        Venus is similar in size to Earth but has a runaway greenhouse effect—dense clouds of sulfuric acid and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. It rotates slowly in a retrograde direction.

   <span>The Sun.</span>
    <p>The Sun is a massive, glowing ball of hot gas at the center of our solar system.Through nuclear fusion, it turns hydrogen into helium, releasing the energy that gives us light and heat.</p>
    <ol class="li">
        <b>It is made out of 2 elements</b>
        <li> hydrogen (about 74%) </li>
        <li>helium (about 24%),</li>
    </ol>
    <ul class="li">
        <b>But how does the nuclear fusion occurs?</b>
        <li>The Sun's core is extremely hot and dense, allowing nuclear fusion to occur.</li>
        <li>In this process, four hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form one helium nucleus.</li>
        <li>This reaction releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat.</li>
        <li>The energy moves outward through the Sun's layers and eventually reaches Earth as sunlight.</li>
    </ul>
